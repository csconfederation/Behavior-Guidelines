<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Excessively spamming text chat with text or reactions</td>
<td>Any instance of posting the same message, image, or gif either a. multiple times in one channel, b. once in multiple channels, or c. in multiple different CSC discords will be considered spam. This also applies to in-game chats. Reacting to many messages, in one channel or multiple channels, with the same or different reactions, can also lead to a mute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Spamming voice chat/spam joining voice</td>
<td>Repeatedly joining and leaving, or rapidly moving between, a voice channel in the CSC discord will warrant a punishment for spam joining. You may also be warned under this rule for any instance of voice changers or loud sounds played in a voice channel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>General misuse of channels</td>
<td>Any messages that divert from the intended topic of a channel, such as regular discussion in #ask-a-coach or #introductions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Baiting other community members</td>
<td>Creating unnecessary drama, manipulation of others, or being overly judgmental or critical of others, especially when done to generate a reaction from someone. Includes attacks or insults through in-game chat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Falsely/incorrectly reporting scores</td>
<td>Intentionally lying in a score report to either misrepresent the correct score or reporting the wrong winner will be warned under this rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>Excessive or Unnecessary pings</td>
<td>Pinging  roles/individuals for no apparent reason. This can also apply to spam pinging an individual, or pinging after being asked to stop. No roles should be pinged between 3am-10a EST (other than mod/after dark roles)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>Non-English text in chat</td>
<td>Self explanatory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>Being generally disrespectful, rude or toxic to community members</td>
<td>This refers to harassment of other players, including, but not limited to: verbal insults, text insults, and repeated, overt sarcastic responses in both text or voice chat. This can include DMs brought to the attention of the moderators. It is primarily up to moderator discretion whether or not to punish for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48</td>
<td>Suggestive Media</td>
<td>Posting any images, gifs, text, or videos that can be considered not safe for work (NSFW) but are not explicit or graphic. This is including but not limited to innuendos, suggestive content or sexual references (graphic or implied)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>49</td>
<td>Mentioning or alluding to self-harm</td>
<td>Any instances of messages, images or gifs which mention or allude to self harm in any CSC discord channel</td>

<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>Explicit Conversations</td>
<td>Conversations referring to sex or any topic that might make a movie rated R. Many of us in CSC are adults. Many of us are not. Nobody is here to hear random rated-R tales. There is near-zero reason for these topics to be discussed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>Pinging a role without approval</td>
<td>Pinging roles, such as Event Interest, without approval will warrant an immediate mute unless approved by admins or blanket permission has been given to a staff role (ex. Media does not need approval to ping stream interest when announcing a stream).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>Collaborating in Commiting Minor Misbehaviors</td>
<td>Any confirmed efforts to work together to commit misbehaviors. Strikes in this area are applied to all applicable members involved who have been shown to actively participate in preparing for the infraction(s).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>14</td>
<td>General conduct detrimental to CSC</td>
<td>Any conduct that a new user would be turned away by seeing can be punished. This is a blanket rule for moderator discretion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>Asking for specific punishments for others</td>
<td>Requesting, in public, that someone be muted for breaking a rule. Please use tickets for player reports. At Mod discretion, you may instead receive exactly what you asked for, applied to you, and additional strikes may be incurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16</td>
<td>NSFW media</td>
<td>Posting any images, gifs, or videos that are considered not safe for work (NSFW) or other public locations due to nudity, sexual content, gore, extreme violence, or other aspects. Drastically or overtly explicit materials will instantly incur 3 strikes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17</td>
<td>Swearing directed at another member</td>
<td>Self explanatory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>18</td>
<td>False accusations of serious offence</td>
<td>Publicly accusing a member of harassment when no such thing has been done, for example, would warrant a mute under this rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>19</td>
<td>Public accusation of staff abuse</td>
<td>Publicly accusing a Mod of abuse for muting you, for example, would warrant a mute under this rule. This can also cover baseless accusations made in tickets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>Encouraging drama or rule breaking, or promising to do so</td>
<td>Any discovered attempts to encourage or bait other members into committing offences, or statements confirming intent to do so. Continuing or reigniting hostile conversations, making false accusations, saying you will intentionally break rules, etc. may also fall under this rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>Testing, taunting, or baiting mods</td>
<td>Trying a mods patience, whether it be by pushing limits outside, or within, other rulebreaking, trying to garner a negative reaction from a staff member, or trying to bait mods into levying punishments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>22</td>
