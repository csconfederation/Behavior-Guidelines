reactions Any instance of posting the same message, image, or gif either a. multiple times in one channel, b. once in multiple channels, or c. in multiple different CSC discords will be considered spam. This also applies to in-game chats. Reacting to many messages, in one channel or multiple channels, with the same or different reactions, can also lead to a mute. 2 Spamming voice chat/spam joining voice Repeatedly joining and leaving, or rapidly moving between, a voice channel in the CSC discord will warrant a punishment for spam joining. You may also be warned under this rule for any instance of voice changers or loud sounds played in a voice channel. 3 General misuse of channels Any messages that divert from the intended topic of a channel, such as regular discussion in #ask-a-coach or #introductions. 4 Baiting other community members Creating unnecessary drama, manipulation of others, or being overly judgmental or critical of others, especially when done to generate a reaction from someone. Includes attacks or insults through in-game chat. 5 Falsely/incorrectly reporting scores Intentionally lying in a score report to either misrepresent the correct score or reporting the wrong winner will be warned under this rule. 7 Excessive or Unnecessary pings Pinging  roles/individuals for no apparent reason. This can also apply to spam pinging an individual, or pinging after being asked to stop. No roles should be pinged between 3am-10a EST (other than mod/after dark roles) 8 Non-English text in chat Self explanatory. 10 Being generally disrespectful, rude or toxic to community members This refers to harassment of other players, including, but not limited to: verbal insults, text insults, and repeated, overt sarcastic responses in both text or voice chat. This can include DMs brought to the attention of the moderators. It is primarily up to moderator discretion whether or not to punish for this. 48 Suggestive Media Posting any images, gifs, text, or videos that can be considered not safe for work (NSFW) but are not explicit or graphic. This is including but not limited to innuendos, suggestive content or sexual references (graphic or implied) 49 Mentioning or alluding to self-harm Any instances of messages, images or gifs which mention or allude to self harm in any CSC discord channel"},{"location":"detailed-misbehavior-descriptions/#normal-offenses","title":"Normal Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 11 Explicit Conversations Conversations referring to sex or any topic that might make a movie rated R. Many of us in CSC are adults. Many of us are not. Nobody is here to hear random rated-R tales. There is near-zero reason for these topics to be discussed. 12 Pinging a role without approval Pinging roles, such as Event Interest, without approval will warrant an immediate mute unless approved by admins or blanket permission has been given to a staff role (ex. Media does not need approval to ping stream interest when announcing a stream). 13 Collaborating in Commiting Minor Misbehaviors Any confirmed efforts to work together to commit misbehaviors. Strikes in this area are applied to all applicable members involved who have been shown to actively participate in preparing for the infraction(s). 14 General conduct detrimental to CSC Any conduct that a new user would be turned away by seeing can be punished. This is a blanket rule for moderator discretion. 15 Asking for specific punishments for others Requesting, in public, that someone be muted for breaking a rule. Please use tickets for player reports. At Mod discretion, you may instead receive exactly what you asked for, applied to you, and additional strikes may be incurred. 16 NSFW media Posting any images, gifs, or videos that are considered not safe for work (NSFW) or other public locations due to nudity, sexual content, gore, extreme violence, or other aspects. Drastically or overtly explicit materials will instantly incur 3 strikes. 17 Swearing directed at another member Self explanatory. 18 False accusations of serious offence Publicly accusing a member of harassment when no such thing has been done, for example, would warrant a mute under this rule. 19 Public accusation of staff abuse Publicly accusing a Mod of abuse for muting you, for example, would warrant a mute under this rule. This can also cover baseless accusations made in tickets. 20 Encouraging drama or rule breaking, or promising to do so Any discovered attempts to encourage or bait other members into committing offences, or statements confirming intent to do so. Continuing or reigniting hostile conversations, making false accusations, saying you will intentionally break rules, etc. may also fall under this rule. 21 Testing, taunting, or baiting mods Trying a mods patience, whether it be by pushing limits outside, or within, other rulebreaking, trying to garner a negative reaction from a staff member, or trying to bait mods into levying punishments. 22 Posting spam links Any posting of links to untrusted/unknown sites or repeated posting of links (i.e. other discord links). If evidence indicates malicious intent, this is instantly elevated to a ban under Rule #41. 23 Discussing politics, religion, or other serious real-life topics in bad faith Discussions regarding politics, religion, or other controversial or otherwise serious real-life topics in bad faith or an offensive manner. Attacking others in conversations related to these topics will likely receive strikes. 24 Harrassment Repeated insulting of another member, even after being asked to stop. 31 Spoiling recent shows or movies (within 2 weeks of release) Defined as intentionally revealing information about recent media (shows, movies, etc. that have come out in the past two weeks) that can spoil the enjoyment of members who are interested in that media, but have not been able to see it yet."},{"location":"detailed-misbehavior-descriptions/#serious-offenses","title":"Serious Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 25 Retaliating Against Staff or Members Lashing out against someone as a response to something they have done, whether it be cutting you, punishing you, reporting you, etc. 26 Impersonating Members of Staff Any attempt to assume the role of another member or staff. This includes staff members, committee roles, or other elevated roles. Impersonation can be done through name changes, profile pictures, steam profiles, or other profiles. 27 False accusations of serious offence towards staff Any accusation of serious nature that requires a discussion or high level investigation found to be blatantly false will give a punishment for false accusations. This is mainly found in false reports of abuse. 28 Continued harassment of community members Harassment continued against the same member after a strike under Rule 24 will warrant an immediate strike for this rule in place of a second Rule 24 strike. 29 Creating a troll discord account Creating a discord account solely to cause trouble in the CSC discord, or any related discord, will result in a ban of the troll account and a strike for the creator. 30 Timing misbehaviors to minimize punishments Any revealed attempts to time potential misbehaviors in such a way as to minimize punishments, such as counting the days until a strike is removed then immediately getting another one. 32 Collaborating in Committing Normal or Serious Misbehaviors Any confirmed efforts to work together to commit misbehaviors. Strikes in this area are applied to all applicable members involved who have been shown to actively participate in preparing for the infraction(s). 37 Slurs, racism and biogted speech Use of highly offensive language, including but not limited to slurs, racism, deliberate misgendering, attacks against someones personal identity or other hateful and bigoted speech. 38 Serious (death/assault) threats Any threat made that involves serious harm to another member, jokingly or not."},{"location":"detailed-misbehavior-descriptions/#other-offenses","title":"Other Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 34 Bypassing, or attempting to bypass, punishments in bad faith Any attempts to subvert existing punishments, or to prevent infractions being reported and punished. Includes the use of alternate accounts, or deleting offensive content in an attempt to hide it from mods. 35 Non-serious discussion in serious channels Any completely off-topic conversation or statements in serious-suggestion/discussion, election channels, or other serious channels. 36 Leaving Discord mid-event Leaving a voice channel, the CSC discord, or discord server created for an event while participating in that event. 39 Leaving Discord mid-season without reason These will be reviewed on a case by case basis, and the punishment can extend into the following season(s). 40 Pinging large roles without approval Pinging @everyone, @League, @Spectator, @Former Player, etc. without approval 41 Posting scam links Posting malicious links with the intent of stealing IPs, account information, or anything else of ill intent. 42 Breaking Discord TOS Actions that go against Discord's TOS, found at https://discord.com/terms 44 Trolling with ill intent immediately after joining Joining the server just to incite drama, protest a punishment for a friend, etc. 45 Scamming or attempted scamming Self explanatory. 47 Messaging automoderated terms Messaging a banned word that is automatically deleted by automod. Resending deleted messages will result in a double strike. Any successful attempt to avoid automod with banned words will be treated as a 37. 51 Doxxing The sharing of any previously publicly unknown personal information without their consent that could reasonably be used to identify or harass the individual. This includes but is not limited to full names, aliases, surnames, dead names, images, age, and addresses. For the purpose of this strike, information shared by the individual in a reasonably public channel within CSC (ie chats in General Channels, League Channels, Tier Channels, and Off topic channels) or directly related social media accounts (ie accounts linked to your discord account or sharing the same username as your discord name or CSC name) is considered publicly known personal information.
